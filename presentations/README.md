# Presentations

Material for two presentations of deep learning applications for biodiversity monitoring from drone imagery

1. A 15-minute overview - intro to neural networks, overview of their use in remote sensing, and a dive through what we cover in the longer workshop

2. Three 20-ish minute explainers that accompany the workshop notebooks. One on preparing your training data, one on model training and fine-tuning, one on evaluation and inference. The notebooks plus the presentation should stretch to a day-long training course.

## Caveats

The draft materials in the initial commit are generated in sessions with LLMs - Claude for the overview and diagrams, CoPilot for the Unet specifics when Claude ran out of credit. For a head-start on non-original subject matter where we're trying to demystify something that's already well documented for a general audience, it seems more acceptable?
